A concise guide to **Prompt Engineering** — the practice of designing effective prompts to get accurate, consistent, and high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT.

## What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt Engineering is the process of structuring inputs (prompts) to guide AI models toward desired behavior, reasoning, and output formats.

## Why It Matters
- Improves response accuracy
- Reduces hallucinations
- Controls tone, structure, and depth
- Powers AI agents and automation

## Basic Prompt Structure
A good prompt usually includes:
- Role – who the AI should act as  
- Task – what it should do  
- Context – background information  
- Constraints – rules or limits  
- Output Format – expected response style  

## ExampleYou are a data analyst.
Analyze the dataset and summarize key trends.
Use bullet points and keep it under 100 words
